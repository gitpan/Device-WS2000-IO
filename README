NAME
    Device::WS2000::IO - Perl extension for reading data from the ELV
    Weatherstation WS2000 PC

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::WS2000::IO qw (:all);
      $ok=open_ws("ttyS0");
      send_ws($command,$parameter);
      @buffer = read_ws();
      close_ws();

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains lowlevel-routines for the communication with the
    ELV Weatherstation WS2000 PC connected to a serial port.

    Following functions are implemented:

    open_ws ($port) opens the serial port and checks initial response,
    returns 1 on success, 0 on failure

    send_ws ($cmd,$par) send a command to the WS2000 Legal commands are: 0
    read DCF-Time 1 read one datablock 2 next datablock 3 nine sensors 4 16
    sensors 5 get status 6 uses parameter: set poll interval 1 - 60 minutes

    read_ws read response from WS2000 returns read buffer length is checked
    envelope is removed checksum is not yet checked (blame on me)

    close_ws closes the serial port

  EXPORT

    None by default.

    Tag :all open_ws close_ws send_ws read_ws

Thanks
    My thanks go out to Friedrich Zabel for the C-Code used for the
    low-level functions, taken from his project wx2000 at
    http://wx2000.sourceforge.net/

    To the opensource comunity in general which time and again show that
    sharing / modifying code and returning it to all users actualy works.
